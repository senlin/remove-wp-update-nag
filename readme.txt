The free Remove WP Update Nags plugin is aimed at people who like to keep their WordPress sites on version 4.9.x and do not want to be constantly "reminded" of that most likely conscious decision.

== Description ==

> GDPR-compliant: does not collect any user data

If you have decided to stay on WordPress version 4.9.x instead of joining the block-craze going on in WP-circles, then you will quickly get tired of the constant nags all over the WordPress Dashboard.

### ClassicPress Compatible

Because ClassicPress is forked on WP 4.9.8 the Remove WP Update Nags plugin is automatically also compatible with ClassicPress.

### Gutenberg Compatible

Pinyin Slugs also works with the new WP editor (Gutenberg) although the slugs are only changed upon saving the post/page, not immediately. This has to do with the way this new editor works.
